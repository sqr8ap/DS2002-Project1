# DS2002-Project1

This repo contains our group's project 1 files. The SQL file creates the chinook database, and the Jupyter Notebook contains the end-to-end ETL process we executed. 

For this project, we designed a dimensional data mart and developed an ETL pipeline to populate the data mart. We also authored a Jupyter Notebook to integrate data from multiple sources, SQL queries to demonstrate functionality of the resulting database schema, and documentation of the process.
